## Hi there I'm Selvet! ðŸ‘‹


I completed my undergrad education in the field of Astronomy, and that's when I met data science and studied data analysis with big data (I did my undergrad thesis on Gravitational Waves: Theory and Analysis).
I believe that my educational background has provided me with valuable skills to thrive in this field.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python for data science, machine learning, and deep learning.
- ðŸ”¥ My goal is to become a data scientist.

- âœ¨ Fun fact: I am currently a tattoo artist! I've been a tattoo artist for 2 years but now I just want to focus on programming in general.
